            <p>Nothing is as it seems in Tree Hill, North Carolina. Meet the characters who love to call this place home.</p>
            <p>Lucas Scott. Tortured basketball player and lover of classic novels. Lucas Scott is the underdog, the forgotten, and unwanted, son of basketball legend Dan Scott. Lucas will do whatever it takes to defend himself, his loved ones, and his game, even if that means forgoing his dignity in the process.</p>
            <p>Nathan Scott. All-star basketball player and womanizer. Nathan Scott, son of basketball legend Dan Scott, is arrogant, entitled, and will do whatever it takes to win, even if that means losing the things he holds close. But maybe there is more to him than initially meets the eye?</p>
            <p>Haley James. Lucas Scotts childhood best friend and biggest supporter. Haley James tutors at Tree Hill High, and is a loyal waitress at Karens cafe. Often forgotten by her parents due to her large family, Haley James knows what it feels like to be overlooked. But her empathy, combined with her loyalty to Lucas, pose significant challenges for her future in Tree Hill.</p>
            <p>Peyton Sawyer. Tree Hills resident tortured artist and music fanatic. Loss seems to be a central part of this cheerleaders life, but with the help of best friend Brooke Davis, she turns her pain into art. Mysterious and misunderstood, Peyton Sawyer is a complicated character, one who tends to keep her emotions locked down. Until Lucas Scott, and One Tree Hill, threaten to find the key.</p>
            <p>Brooke Davis. The most popular, and spoiled, girl in school. As captain of the cheerleading squad, Brooke takes her job very seriously. Charming, beautiful, and witty, Brooke Davis knows how to break hearts, and in the case of best friend Peyton Sawyer, knows how to mend them as well. But when Brooke wants something, she gets it, even if it means competing with her closest ally.</p>
